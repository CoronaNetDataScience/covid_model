The ‘admin1CodesASCII.txt” file lists has data on regions/states within a country and
the ‘countryInfo.txt” file has data on the different countries.

The ‘country_region_clean.csv’ contains the cleaned data to copy and paste into the Qualtrics survey instrument and contains the relevant data for provinces/states for each country

The ‘countries_qualtrics.csv’ contains the data on countries from the Qualtrics questions library
