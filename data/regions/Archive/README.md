## country-region-data 

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/country-regions/country-region-data.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/country-regions/country-region-data)

This repo contains a static JSON file of country names, country short codes, country regions, and country region short 
codes. All country names and short codes are guaranteed to be unique. Similarly, all regions and region short
codes *within a single country* are guaranteed to be unique.

I created this repo to house the raw data used for the [country-region-selector](https://github.com/country-regions/country-region-selector),
[react-country-region-selector](https://github.com/country-regions/react-country-region-selector) scripts. I didn't want to 
duplicate it in multiple places and hey, it seemed like this could be useful as a standalone repo.

See the `data.json` file for the data. The JSON is of the form:

```javascript
[
  {
    "countryName":"Ecuador",
    "countryShortCode":"EC",
    "regions":[
      {
        "name":"Azuay",
        "shortCode":"A"
      },
      ...
    }
  },
  ... 
]
```

### Contribute

The state/prov abbreviations are not yet complete, so pull requests welcome! Regions that need ISO3166-2 codes can 
be identified by having a missing `shortCode` property for each region. You can find them by cloning the repo, then 
running:

```
npm install
grunt findIncomplete
```

That'll list all countries with regions that are missing region short codes. Wikipedia has a lot of the data listed here:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2


### Data Validation

Before contributing a PR, please validate the JSON content (if you don't, Travis will catch it for you!). To do that, 
run the following on your command line:

```
npm install
grunt validate
```

That'll throw an error if the JSON is invalid or if some duplicate names were accidentally introduced. The error messages 
are pretty clear, I think.
