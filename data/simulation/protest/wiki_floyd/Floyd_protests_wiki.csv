Minnesota,Minneapolis–Saint Paul,"Protests emerged during midday on May 26, the day after Floyd's death and after video of the arrest had been widely circulated in the media.[12] A makeshift memorial was created at East 38th Street and Chicago Avenue where the incident with Floyd and the Minneapolis police took place. Some protesters that gathered there chanted, ""I can't breathe, I can't breathe"", words repeated multiple times by Floyd in the video.[13] As thousands of people flooded the same intersection, organizers emphasized keeping the protest peaceful.[14] By the middle of the afternoon, Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo had fired the city's four officers at the scene of Floyd's arrest and death, a moved supported by Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey. However, Floyd's family and protesters called for murder charges for all four officers involved and swift judicial consequences, as the FBI and Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension opened investigations of the incident. Bob Kroll, president of the Minneapolis police officer's union, said the firing of the officers came without due process and offered ""full support of the officers"" while investigations be completed in full.[15][16][17] The evening, the protest rally at the location of Floyd's death turned into a march to the Minneapolis Police Department's third precinct police station where the four officers involved were believed to work. At the station, a group of protesters began vandalizing the building, shattering a window, and spray painting squad cars. Some also breached the station’s parking lot. Officers in riot gear emerged and fired tear gas and flash grenades; in response protesters hurled rocks, water bottles, and anything they could get their hands on towards the officers. The unruly crowd clashing with the police was measured in the hundreds, and noted as a contrast from the peaceful group at the start of the protest.[13][14] A separate group of protesters gathered outside the Oakdale home of Derek Chauvin that night.[13]","https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/27/us/gallery/george-floyd-demonstrations/index.html , https://kstp.com/news/protesters-block-minneapolis-intersection-near-site-of-mans-in-custody-death-george-floyd/5741748/ , https://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2020/05/26/hundreds-of-protesters-march-in-minneapolis-after-george-floyds-deadly-encounter-with-police/ , https://time.com/5842687/george-floyd-killed-minneapolis-police/ , https://kstp.com/minnesota-news/minneapolis-police-george-floyd-death-/5741256/ , https://www.kare11.com/article/news/local/george-floyd/minneapolis-police-union-president-officers-in-george-floyd-case-terminated-without-due-process/89-fa7fb13a-d167-472e-bf3c-e2d6259f8f6d",1000,26/05,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,Diego,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Floyd_protests_in_Minneapolis%E2%80%93Saint_Paul,
Minnesota,Minneapolis–Saint Paul,"Protests in Minneapolis resumed on May 27 at locations throughout the city. At the location where Floyd died, protesters were led through prayer and a series of chants. By late morning, a group of protesters blocked the nearby intersection as they chanted, “Whose streets? Our streets.” Some protesters left memorials by the Cup Foods store, while some spray painted the words “Justice for Floyd” and “Black Lives Matter” on the street surface. No police were present and the scene was peaceful.[18] The tone of protests shifted that afternoon when a crowd gathered at the third precinct station two miles (3.2 km) from the spot were Floyd died. Police fired rubber bullets and chemical irritants as some protesters began breaking the precinct's windows. Activists helped stopped others who tried to vandalize the building further. As police advanced with force and tear gas, protesters scattered throughout the area.[19] Later in the evening, an AutoZone store on East Lake Street was set on fire just steps away from the third police precinct station. The situation worsened when a nearby Target store was extensively looted by a crowd of about 100 people.[20] One mile (1.6 km) from the main protest site, Calvin Horton Jr., a 43-year old man from Minneapolis, was fatally shot by a pawnshop owner who believed he was burglarizing his business. The shop's owner, a 59-year-old man from Galesville, Wisconsin, was arrested on possible murder charges.[21][3] Violence continued overnight, as rioters ignited fires and looted stores across the city, which stood as a stark contrast to the mostly peaceful protests earlier that day. Dozens of buildings were looted or destroyed along the city's busy north and south side business corridors, with most incidents occurring in the vicinity of the third precinct station.[22] Among the losses was Minnehaha Commons, an under-construction, $30 million redevelopment project for 189 units of affordable housing, which was destroyed by fire after being torched.[23]","https://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2020/05/27/protesters-gather-where-george-floyd-was-killed-as-well-as-mpd-3rd-precinct-oakdale-home/ , https://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2020/05/27/protesters-gather-where-george-floyd-was-killed-as-well-as-mpd-3rd-precinct-oakdale-home/ , https://www.fox9.com/news/looting-and-fires-break-out-after-protests-in-minneapolis-following-death-of-george-floyd , https://www.startribune.com/shooting-death-near-minneapolis-protest-george-floyd-calls-for-ex-officer-s-arrest/570804062/",100,27/05,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,Diego,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Floyd_protests_in_Minneapolis%E2%80%93Saint_Paul,
Minnesota,Minneapolis–Saint Paul,"By the morning, more than 30 businesses in Minneapolis had been damaged or destroyed by rioters.[24] Arradondo remarked that in his view the majority of protests the previous day were peaceful, but that public displays were “hijacked” by some who were looting and vandalizing businesses.[25] To quell rioting behavior, Frey declared a state of emergency to have more flexibility in the city's response, while Minnesota Governor Tim Walz activated 500 Minnesota National Guard troops at the request of leaders in Minneapolis and Saint Paul and deployed them to the Twin Cities area. Frey and Walz expressed sympathy for the community's sense of anger and the right to protest for systematic change, but condemned the destruction of property by some protesters.[26][27] Businesses across the Twin Cities spent the day boarding up windows and doors to prevent looting. Among them, the Target Corporation announced closures for all of its area stores. Saint Paul police officers armed with batons and gas masks kept an eye the city's busiest commercial coordinator and kept looters out of a Target store while other business windows were smashed. Minneapolis preemptively shut down its light-rail system and bus service through Sunday out of safety concerns. Officials pleaded with metro area residents to stay home that night to prevent further property destruction. Saint Paul Mayor Melvin Carter, who is black, said, “Please stay home. Please do not come here to protest. Please keep the focus on George Floyd, on advancing our movement and on preventing this from ever happening again.”[28] Thousands of peaceful protesters marched the streets and called for justice for Floyd during the day. However, that evening, hundreds of demonstrators in Minneapolis returned to the area near city's the third precinct police station, where looting of a nearby Target store resumed and a vehicle and building were set on fire. The focus of demonstrators shifted to the third precinct police station. As fencing surrounding the precinct station was torn down, police used tear gas against protesters. Tensions and fires in the area mounted. Later in the night, Frey gave the order to evacuate the third precinct station, a tactic he later said was to deescalate the situation and prevent further loss of life. The third precinct station was then overrun by protesters and the police station building itself set on fire.[29][28] There were no police, fire, or emergency medical services presence in the area where the riots occurred after 10:00 p.m. CDT on May 28 as live television news broadcast scenes of escalating destruction.[30] In neighboring Saint Paul, which had been spared from the chaos on Wednesday night, 170 businesses were damaged or looted and dozens of fires had been started, with the largest ones near Snelling and University avenues, but no major injuries were reported.[31]","https://www.startribune.com/minneapolis-mayor-frey-calls-for-peace-as-looting-flames-erupt-around-police-station/570816112/ , https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/05/27/george-floyd-minneapolis-reaction/ , https://kstp.com/news/minnesota-national-guard-activated-to-control-protests-following-george-floyds-death/5743967/ , https://kstp.com/news/minnesota-national-guard-activated-to-control-protests-following-george-floyds-death/5743967/ , https://www.kcra.com/article/minneapolis-police-precinct-on-fire-as-protests-grow/32706050# , https://www.cnn.com/videos/us/2020/05/29/george-floyd-minneapolis-protest-vpx.cnn , https://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2020/05/29/protesters-take-minneapolis-police-3rd-precinct-building-during-3rd-night-of-george-floyd-protests/",1000,28/5,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,Diego ,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Floyd_protests_in_Minneapolis%E2%80%93Saint_Paul,
Minnesota,Minneapolis–Saint Paul,"Frey address the media at 1:30 a.m. CDT as the city was battling multiple fires and violence. Frey acknowledged the pain of the community over Floyd's death, but condemned the actions of rioters and looters. In defense of his decision Thursday night to have police withdraw from the third precinct station, he said, ""Brick and mortar is not as important as life"".[32] That afternoon, Walz imposed a curfew for the cities of Minneapolis and Saint Paul that would run from 8:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. on Friday, May 29 and Saturday, May 30.[33][34] Frey also issued a similar curfew in Minneapolis.[35] The Target Corporation expanded its closure of stores to 73 in Minnesota due to the rioting.[36] In the late afternoon, Hennepin County Attorney Michael O. Freeman charged Derek Chauvin, the officer who knelt on Floyd's neck as he died, with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter, but he left the matter ongoing about chargers for officers Lane, Kueng, and Thao who were at the scene of Floyd's death. Protesters, who had demanded immediate murder charges against all four officers, were disappointed after waiting four days since Floyd's death and made the criminal charges a big part of their message that day.[37] Despite the announcement of the charges and the new curfew, riots broke out again on Friday night and continued into early Saturday morning, with much of the action taking place adjacent to the Minneapolis police fifth precinct station near Lake Street and Nicollet Avenue.[38] Law enforcement presence was reportedly ""undetectable"", as violence in Minneapolis quickly grew until just before midnight, when police officers, state troopers, and members of the National Guard began confronting rioters with tear gas and mass force.[38] Officials later said that the 350 police officers at the site of rioting near the Minneapolis fifth precinct station were vastly outnumbered by the crowds.[39] As the events unfolded that night, the Pentagon placed members of the Military Police Corps from Fort Bragg and Fort Drum on stand-by, preparing for possible deployment to the Twin Cities if requested by Walz.[40] Walz later declined the offer and activated all of the state's National Guard, up to 13,200 troops.[41]","https://twitter.com/TheoKeith/status/1266476548321882114 , https://twitter.com/TheoKeith/status/1266476867055386626 , https://kttc.com/2020/05/29/minneapolis-mayor-imposes-curfew-for-friday-saturday/ , https://bringmethenews.com/minnesota-news/target-now-closing-73-stores-across-minnesota-until-further-notice , https://www.fox9.com/news/what-charges-is-former-officer-derek-chauvin-facing-in-the-death-of-george-floyd , https://www.startribune.com/walz-this-is-about-chaos-as-new-fires-looting-hit-mpls/570882282/ , https://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2020/05/30/protesters-defy-minneapolis-curfew-order-several-fires-set-during-4th-night-of-unrest-over-george-floyds-death/ , https://apnews.com/cf9947a3ca9f3225f9645fd330403eae , https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/30/us/minneapolis-floyd-protests.html#link-4737bd55",Unknown,29/05,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,Diego,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Floyd_protests_in_Minneapolis%E2%80%93Saint_Paul,
Minnesota,Minneapolis–Saint Paul,"The sound of helicopters and smoke were present in Minneapolis through the night as multiple fires burned near the fifth police precinct. A United States Post Office on Nicollet, a Wells Fargo Bank branch, and several gas stations, among other business, blazed. Fire officials were unable to immediately attend to major fires, citing security concerns at the sites, but later reached them when the area was cleared of protesters.[42] For the second time in as many nights, officials held a press conference at 1:30 a.m. CDT, but this time in Saint Paul and led by the governor and state officials. Some officials speculated that much of the destruction was being caused by people from outside the state, a claim that was later contradicted by arrest records of protesters and that officials walked back.[43] It was reported that Frey and Walz appeared visibly exhausted as they made emotional pleas to the public about Floyd's death and the escalation of violence. “The absolute chaos — this is not grieving, and this is not making a statement [about an injustice] that we fully acknowledge needs to be fixed — this is dangerous,” Walz said. “You need to go home.” Walz also took responsibility for under estimating the size of the crowd causing deconstruction earlier in the night.[42] By the day, 2,500 officers were deployed and 50 people had been arrested in relation to the protests. Major General Jon Jensen of the Minnesota National Guard said that by May 31, over 1,700 National Guard soldiers could be deployed, the largest deployment in the state's history.[44] Jensen confirmed that 2,500 Guards would be deployed by noon.[45] Crowds of people continued to gather at the makeshift memorial at the site of Floyd's arrest and subsequent death.[46] Minneapolis police reported that another group of protesters near Hiawatha Avenue and Lake Street were attacking police by throwing nondescript objects, and deployed more units to the area.[47] That night after curfew, police fired tear gas at a group of protesters who were attempting to march from Minneapolis to Saint Paul via the Lake Street bridge.[46]","https://www.startribune.com/walz-bolsters-guard-troops-after-4th-destructive-night/570882282/ , https://www.mprnews.org/story/2020/05/30/outsiders-extremists-are-among-those-fomenting-violence-in-twin-cities , https://edition.cnn.com/us/live-news/george-floyd-protests-05-30-20/h_63b0bee1feb26157b0f14a0e05f8900a , https://www.news.com.au/world/breaking-news/us-protesters-torch-police-station/news-story/c192f51a394a71a485f81a43a49c4310 , https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/george-floyd-protests-05-30-20/index.html ,",Unknown,30/05,1,0,1,1,50,1,1,Diego,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Floyd_protests_in_Minneapolis%E2%80%93Saint_Paul,

After the driver came to a halt, he was pulled from his cab and beaten by the surrounding crowd. He suffered minor injuries, with some of the protesters attempting to protect him. The people delivered the driver to the police, who then pepper-sprayed the crowd. The truck driver, later identified as Bogdan Vechirko, was taken to Hennepin County Medical Center then released into the custody of the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, who charged him with assault.[51][52] No serious injuries to the people on the bridge were reported.[51] Minnesota Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington denied that Vechirko did the act intentionally.[53] The same day, it was agreed that Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison would assist in the investigation.[54]","https://edition.cnn.com/us/live-news/george-floyd-protests-05-30-20/h_f42fc576cf6a1324cbc9b91ee8ff0cee , https://edition.cnn.com/us/live-news/george-floyd-protests-05-31-20/h_7cea6d26defb558cc8c27938b1756c96 , https://bringmethenews.com/minnesota-news/video-shows-tanker-truck-speed-towards-protesters-on-i-35w-bridge-in-minneapolis , https://heavy.com/news/2020/05/bogdan-vechirko/ , https://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2020/05/31/breaking-semi-truck-appears-to-drive-through-protest-marchers-on-i-35w-bridge/ , https://edition.cnn.com/us/live-news/george-floyd-protests-06-01-20/h_d7b23d19cd7adcfeb49b30454ef03b2d , https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-attorney-general-to-assist-in-george-floyd-case/570910352/",6000,31/05,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,Diego,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Floyd_protests_in_Minneapolis%E2%80%93Saint_Paul,

The successfully peaceful march drew praise from police Commissioner Dermot Shea.[26] In Foley Square, NYPD Lieutenant Robert Cattani knelt with a small number of other officers at the request of protesters. A few days later he apologized for doing so, saying that he knelt in the hope that it would make the protesters less likely to use violence, but that it was a ""horrible decision"" that ruined his reputation and ""goes against every principle and value that I stand for"".[29][30]In Brooklyn, about 500 protesters gathered around a stage set up in Grand Army Plaza for a rally.

Whereas typically citizens pause at 7:00 pm to publicly applaud medical personnel and other essential workers, on this day the doctors turned up to support black victims of police violence and call attention to systemic inequities through which the coronavirus has similarly disproportionately affected communities of color.[38] After 8:00, police began making arrests both for violation of curfew and for suspicion of looting, but arrest numbers dropped significantly from the previous day to about 280.[40] Some remained outside after the curfew, including a group trying to cross Manhattan Bridge leading to a standoff with a police that resolved without incident.[38] There were broken windows and reports of looting around Union Square, Astor Place, and Greenwich Village, sometimes thwarted by other protesters.[38]",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/01/nyregion/nyc-protests-george-floyd.html https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/01/nyregion/nyc-protests-george-floyd.html https://www.nytimes.com/article/nyc-curfew.html https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/home/downloads/pdf/executive-orders/2020/eeo-119.pdf https://www.nytimes.com/article/nyc-curfew.html https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/nyregion/nyc-protests-george-floyd.html,1000,02/06,1,0,1,1,280,1,1,Keshana,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Floyd_protests_in_New_York_City,

Cars in the Brooklyn-bound roadway honked their horns and raised their fists in solidarity with the protesters.[47] In the afternoon, Assemblywoman Diana Richardson and New York State Senator Zellnor Myrie, along with the Black, Puerto Rican, Hispanic & Asian Legislative Caucus, held a press conference at 20 Grand Army Plaza where they introduced a package of police reform legislation.[50] Attendees of the rally marched peacefully through Brooklyn after the event.[51][52] Right before the 8:00 pm curfew, police officers kettled hundreds of peaceful protesters in the Mott Haven neighborhood of South Bronx. People marching down 136th Street encountered armored bicycle police while another group of officers blocked off the other end of the street, pushing protesters into the police on bicycles. The demonstrators caught in the middle were pepper sprayed, several were struck with batons, and some were tackled and arrested.[53] In total, 260 people were arrested, including journalists and at least 11 legal observers of the National Lawyers Guild (NLG). Legal observers were exempt from the curfew, and the local chapter of the NLG said the observers were targets of intentional harassment by police.[54] Terence Monahan, who oversaw the event, as well as the NYPD, were criticized by both local media and neighborhood residents for their aggressive actions.[53] Dermot Shea said the intervention was ""executed nearly flawlessly"" and justified police actions by citing ""outside agitators"" that he said were planning to ""burn things down ... injure cops ... [and] cause mayhem.[53][54] Aggressive post-curfew policing also occurred later in the evening in Fort Greene and Williamsburg, Brooklyn, where officers charged into a group of demonstrators, tackling protesters to the ground and making multiple arrests.[52][53] In Clinton Hill, a march was met by police later in the evening, with people pushe to the ground, hit with batons.
