WILMINGTON, Del. – Governor John Carney on Wednesday announced a partnership with the Delaware Division of Public Health (DPH), the Delaware Department of Health and Social Services (DHSS), the Delaware Emergency Management Agency, the Delaware Department of Agriculture, Westside Family Healthcare, local hospital systems, poultry industry employers, Federally Qualified Health Centers, and trusted community partners to stand up community testing sites in Sussex County, and increase outreach and distribution of educational materials about COVID-19 in southern Delaware.

    “We’ve seen a significant surge in COVID-19 cases in communities across Sussex County,” said Governor John Carney. “This new testing program is designed to save lives. Over the next week, we will be partnering with local hospitals, the Delaware Division of Public Health, the Delaware Department of Health and Social Services, the Delaware Emergency Management Agency, and the Delaware Department of Agriculture, and others to offer free, rapid coronavirus testing at community testing sites in Sussex County. As the largest employers in Sussex County, we are partnering with the poultry industry to ensure that workers and their families get all of the information they need to be safe and healthy.”

The community testing plan is a three-pronged effort. It includes testing through the use of rapid test kits and ensuring access to care; guidance on isolation and assistance when it is not possible to isolate safely; and education and outreach through the assistance of trusted community partners. Individuals will receive “care kits” with essential materials including hand sanitizer, bandanas, thermometers, and educational materials. Educational materials are being translated into Spanish and Haitian Creole to reach those who do not read English as their first language.

    The ability to prevent infection in people who are at risk for more severe COVID-19;
    The ability of the hospital and health systems to handle surges;

Governor Gina M. Raimondo today provided an update on the state of COVID-19 testing in Rhode Island and announced an ambitious goal to test 10,000 Rhode Islanders a day by July.

She also outlined the state's comprehensive testing strategy:

• Ensure rapid testing of all symptomatic people. This will involve expanding the number of testing sites in Rhode Island as well as the state's mobile testing capacity. • React quickly to outbreaks. The plan calls for an outbreak response team on the ground within four hours of multiple cases discovered in places like congregate care settings, workplaces, and other high-density areas. This team will also conduct rapid testing of any contacts who may have been exposed. • Create an early warning system by testing groups of asymptomatic individuals. The state needs to be able to test comprehensively in high-risk settings like nursing homes or group homes. The state will also perform cyclical testing for other high-risk populations, such as healthcare workers and first responders. Early warning testing sites will be set up at high-contact workplaces and other community settings. The state will work with schools, universities, and private sector partners to set up early warning testing for their own populations. And representative sampling will allow the state to better understand community spread.",Health Resources,Other Heath Staff,NA,original,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Mandatory (Unspecified/Implied),https://www.ri.gov/press/view/38289,USA,US

   Montana Governor Steve Bullock issued a directive to expand insurance coverage to allow Montanans to access routine health care services while social distancing. 
   The second directive makes it easier for Montanans to continue following social distancing guidelines and receive routine health services by requiring health insurers to provide the same coverage for telehealth services for in-person services.

Gyms will be allowed to reopen in 89 of the state’s 95 counties beginning Friday, May 1.

In addition to strict adherence to CDC guidelines, the State recommends gyms, fitness/exercise facilities, or substantially similar facilities and activities put into place an assortment of measures to protect consumers and employees.

Nashville, Tenn. – Tennessee’s Economic Recovery Group released guidance for close contact services today, enabling over 38,000 workers to resume business in 89 of the state’s 95 counties on May 6. Six counties – Shelby, Madison, Davidson, Hamilton, Knox and Sullivan – will create individual plans in consultation with their locally-run health departments.

“As we continue a measured reopening of the economy, it’s critical we provide evidence-based guidance to businesses so they can keep their employees and customers safe,” said Tennessee Governor Bill Lee. “The very nature of close contact businesses calls for strong solutions and we’re inspired by the willingness of these small business owners to take the Tennessee Pledge. These guidelines will allow thousands of businesses to reopen, put their employees back to work, and serve customers in a thoughtful and safe manner.”

In addition to the recommendations included within the Tennessee Pledge, the State recommends strict adherence to CDC guidelines.

    The ability to monitor and protect our communities through testing, contact tracing, isolating, and supporting those who are positive or exposed;
    The ability to prevent infection in people who are at risk for more severe COVID-19;
    The ability of the hospital and health systems to handle surges;
    The ability to develop therapeutics to meet the demand;
    The ability for businesses, schools, and child care facilities to support physical distancing; and

NEW CASTLE (March 12, 2020) – The Department of Health and Social Services (DHSS) is recommending that all Delaware nursing homes, long-term care facilities and adult day-care centers temporarily end visitation as a way to reduce the risk of residents and clients contracting coronavirus disease (COVID-19).

The recommendation follows the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidance that urges long-term care facilities to be vigilant in preventing the introduction and spread of COVID-19. DHSS’ Division of Public Health and DEMA are working with DHSS’ Division of Health Care Quality (DHCQ), Division of Services for Aging and Adults with Physical Disabilities (DSAAPD) and other community partners to implement strategies and restrictions to keep residents safe and healthy. In addition to restricting visitors, DHSS is urging Delaware’s long-term care facilities to:

    Make online methods of face-to face communication and phone calls available.
    Staff should be monitored if they are showing any signs of respiratory infection such as fever, cough or sore throat.
    Any staff member who has these signs or symptoms should not go to work. Any staff that develop these signs or symptoms on the job should immediately stop working, put on a face mask, and self-isolate at home.
    Nursing homes should increase availability of alcohol-based hand sanitizers, tissues, no-touch receptacles for disposal, and face masks at entrances, waiting rooms, and resident check-ins
    Signage should be increased for vigilant infection prevention.
    Properly clean, disinfect, and limit sharing of medical equipment between residents and areas of the facility.

The CDC has found that early data suggests older people are twice as likely to suffer a serious illness from coronavirus disease, also known as COVID-19. Earlier this week, DHSS urged older Delawareans and people with severe chronic health conditions to follow CDC guidance that they “avoid crowds as much as possible” as a way to reduce their risk. Delaware announced its first presumed positive cases this week and the Division of Public Health (DPH) and other state partners are planning for the likelihood of community transmission.

The Department of Health and Social Services advises that community preparedness planning – recommended by CDC – should include older adults and people with disabilities, and the organizations that support them in their communities, to ensure their needs are taken into consideration. Many of these individuals live in the community, and many depend on services and supports provided in their homes or in the community to maintain their independence and their health. For family members and caregivers providing support, the CDC recommends these steps:

    Know what medications your loved one is taking and see if you can help them have extra on hand.
    Monitor food and other medical supplies (oxygen, incontinence, dialysis, wound care) needed and create a back-up plan.
    Stock up on non-perishable food items to have on hand in your home to minimize trips to stores.
    If you care for a loved one living in a care facility, monitor the situation, ask about the health of the other residents frequently and know the protocol if there is an outbreak.

New Guidance for Long-Term and Continuing Care Communities. Prior to the Cabinet meeting, Governor Hogan met with leaders from the long-term care community, which includes nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and retirement communities, to ensure that the administration is working in close coordination to ensure the health and safety of Maryland seniors.

“Older people and those with underlying health conditions are much more vulnerable and at a significantly higher risk of contracting this disease,” said Governor Hogan. “Nursing homes and retirement communities are the areas of greatest concern. This truly is an all-hands-on-deck operation and it is going to get worse before it gets better.”

Older people and those with underlying health conditions are at a significantly higher risk from COVID-19, with morbidity and mortality rates that are three to five times higher than most flu seasons. Governor Hogan announced that the Maryland Department of Health (MDH) is issuing new guidance for facilities that serve older people:

    Restrict access to essential visits only.
    Restrict activities and visitors with potential for exposure.
    Actively screen individuals entering the building and restrict entry to those with respiratory symptoms or possible exposure to COVID-19.
    Require all individuals entering the building to wash their hands at entry.
    Establish processes to allow remote communication for residents and others.
    Prohibit all staff from international travel.

The order also targets facilities providing assisted living, adult day care, hospice and rehabilitation for older adult patients. Facilities where older adults live or that provide services to them are strongly encouraged to implement the recommendations as is reasonably appropriate.

DOH further required that when those limited visitors are allowed in:

    They should have their temperatures taken as a condition of entry, and visitors with a temperature over 100 degrees Fahrenheit or signs of respiratory infection should be barred from entry and advised to seek medical attention;
    Upon entry, they should thoroughly wash hands with soap and water or an alcohol-based sanitizer if soap and water are not available;
    ​They should be escorted by facility staff to and from the patient’s room;
    ​At no time should they be out of the room unescorted.
    To help families stay connected to their loved ones, the Aging and Long-Term Services Department has nine cameras and by March 16 will have 350 tablets that families can use for electronic visits. The agency is exploring other ways to keep residents in touch with loved ones.

Gyms will be allowed to reopen in 89 of the state’s 95 counties beginning Friday, May 1. The counties excluded are those with locally-run health departments: Shelby, Madison, Davidson, Hamilton, Knox, and Sullivan.

“Exercise is incredibly important for the physical and mental health of our population, and we want Tennesseans to have access to safe environments where they can exercise as appropriate,” said Tennessee Governor Bill Lee. “These guidelines outline best practices in keeping with recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and health experts for gyms to reopen in a way that will keep their employees and customers safe.”

In addition to strict adherence to CDC guidelines, the State recommends gyms, fitness/exercise facilities, or substantially similar facilities and activities put into place an assortment of measures to protect consumers and employees.

Nashville, Tenn. – Tennessee’s Economic Recovery Group released guidance for close contact services today, enabling over 38,000 workers to resume business in 89 of the state’s 95 counties on May 6. Six counties – Shelby, Madison, Davidson, Hamilton, Knox and Sullivan – will create individual plans in consultation with their locally-run health departments.

“As we continue a measured reopening of the economy, it’s critical we provide evidence-based guidance to businesses so they can keep their employees and customers safe,” said Tennessee Governor Bill Lee. “The very nature of close contact businesses calls for strong solutions and we’re inspired by the willingness of these small business owners to take the Tennessee Pledge. These guidelines will allow thousands of businesses to reopen, put their employees back to work, and serve customers in a thoughtful and safe manner.”

In addition to the recommendations included within the Tennessee Pledge, the State recommends strict adherence to CDC guidelines.

        Shoe stores
        Sporting goods, hobby, musical instruments

    Cosmetology: Hair care services only are permitted to be offered, and only to workers at essential businesses. Guidelines include:
        No more than two appointments at a time per location (and never more than the number of available staff, so just one for a sole proprietor). Need to leave 15 minutes between appointments for proper cleaning.
        Employees and customers must wear cloth face masks at all times, and customers must cancel appointments if they have any reason to believe they may be ill or may have come into contact with the virus.
        Staff must wear disposable gloves when providing services and must throw away gloves between customers and wash hands.
        Employer must require employees to report their temperature daily — above 99.5 means they are ineligible to work.
        Customer stations must be sanitized between use, along with any equipment used for the customer. In addition, any item a customer handles (like a magazine) must leave with the customer.
        Entrance door must remain locked to outside to prevent walk-ins.

Executive Order 23 – Requiring Tennesseans to Remain at Home

Gov. Lee will sign Executive Order 23 requiring that Tennesseans stay home unless they are carrying out essential activities as data shows an increase in citizen movement across the state.

Data from the Tennessee Department of Transportation analyzed traffic patterns for March 2020. While safer at home measures and further restrictions on businesses showed a steep drop-off in vehicle movement from March 13-29, data beginning on March 30 indicates travel is trending upwards, again.

The Administration also analyzed data from Unacast to understand cell phone mobility and determine movement trends among people. Unacast indicates the movement of Tennesseans is trending toward pre-COVID-19 levels.

The executive order remains in effect until April 14, 2020 at 11:59 p.m. Additional information is available here.",Quarantine,Self-Quarantine (i.e. quarantine at home),NA,original,Tennessee,NA,NA,All Residents (Citizen Residents +Foreign Residents),NA,Not Applicable,Mandatory (Unspecified/Implied),https://www.tn.gov/governor/covid-19/covid-19-daily-bulletin/2020/4/2/covid-19-bulletin--11---april-2--2020.html,USA,US

California’s six indicators for modifying the stay-at-home order are:

    The ability to monitor and protect our communities through testing, contact tracing, isolating, and supporting those who are positive or exposed;
    The ability to prevent infection in people who are at risk for more severe COVID-19;
    The ability of the hospital and health systems to handle surges;
    The ability to develop therapeutics to meet the demand;
    The ability for businesses, schools, and child care facilities to support physical distancing; and
    The ability to determine when to reinstitute certain measures, such as the stay-at-home orders, if necessary.

Under Phase I, certain services and activities are allowed to open with limited occupancy, and the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) is issuing minimum standard health protocols for all businesses and individuals to follow. The Governor also outlined special guidance for Texans over 65 and detailed a comprehensive mitigation plan for nursing homes in Texas. The Governor also announced a statewide testing and tracing program developed by DSHS that will help public health officials quickly identify and test Texans who contract COVID-19 and mitigate further spread of the virus. 

By way of Executive Order (GA-18), all retail stores, restaurants, movie theaters, and malls are permitted to reopen on Friday, May 1. These services must limit their capacity to 25% of their listed occupancy. Within shopping malls, the food-court dining areas, play areas, and interactive displays and settings must remain closed.

All museums and libraries may open under the same 25% occupancy limitation, but interactive areas of museums must remain closed. State libraries and museums will open by May 1, and local public museums and libraries may reopen only if permitted by the local government. Single-person offices may reopen as well.

Churches and places of worship remain open. Outdoor sports are allowed to resume so long as no more than four participants are playing together at one time. Certain social distancing practices must also be followed. Local government operations, including county and municipal government operations relating to permitting, recordation, and document-filing services, may reopen as determined by the local government.

Public swimming pools, bars, gyms, cosmetology salons, massage establishments, interactive amusement venues, such as bowling alleys and video arcades, and tattoo and piercing studios will remain closed through Phase I.

She also outlined the state's comprehensive testing strategy:

• Ensure rapid testing of all symptomatic people. This will involve expanding the number of testing sites in Rhode Island as well as the state's mobile testing capacity. • React quickly to outbreaks. The plan calls for an outbreak response team on the ground within four hours of multiple cases discovered in places like congregate care settings, workplaces, and other high-density areas. This team will also conduct rapid testing of any contacts who may have been exposed. • Create an early warning system by testing groups of asymptomatic individuals. The state needs to be able to test comprehensively in high-risk settings like nursing homes or group homes. The state will also perform cyclical testing for other high-risk populations, such as healthcare workers and first responders. Early warning testing sites will be set up at high-contact workplaces and other community settings. The state will work with schools, universities, and private sector partners to set up early warning testing for their own populations.
